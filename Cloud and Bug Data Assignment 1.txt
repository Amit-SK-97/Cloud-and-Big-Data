This dataset has two tables.
Table 1 is named tutorial.crunchbase_companies and has data on the acquired companies
Table 2 is named tutorial.crunchbase_acquisitions and has data about the aquirer (Primary Key) and its aquisition (Forgien Key)
The table is One to Many relationship
i.e An Acquirer would have invested in more than 1 company
The Data is sourced from mode.com and run on its own hosted SQL editor

Question 1:
Count the number of unique companies and unique acquiring companies by state.
Do not include results for which there is no state data, and order by the number of acquired companies from highest to lowest.

 SELECT funders.state_code,
 COUNT(DISTINCT funders.permalink) AS uniq_companies,
 COUNT(DISTINCT startups.company_permalink) AS uniq_startups
 FROM tutorial.crunchbase_companies funders
 LEFT JOIN tutorial.crunchbase_acquisitions startups
 ON funders.permalink = startups.company_permalink
 WHERE funders.state_code IS NOT NULL
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 3 DESC
 
 Question 2:
 A query that shows a company's name, "status" (found in the Companies table), and the number of unique investors in that company. 
 Order by the number of investors from most to fewest. Limit to only companies in the state of New York.
 
 SELECT funders.name AS name_of_the_company,
 funders.status,
 COUNT(DISTINCT startups.investor_name) AS uniq_investors
 FROM tutorial.crunchbase_companies funders
 LEFT JOIN tutorial.crunchbase_investments startups
 ON funders.permalink = startups.company_permalink
 WHERE funders.state_code = 'NY'
 GROUP BY 1,2
 ORDER BY 3 DESC
 
 
 Question 3:
 Write a query that lists investors based on the number of companies in which they are invested. 
 Include a row for companies with no investor, and order from most companies to least.
 
 SELECT CASE WHEN startups.investor_name IS NULL THEN 'No Investors'
 ELSE startups.investor_name END AS investor,
 COUNT(DISTINCT funders.permalink) AS invested_companies
 FROM tutorial.crunchbase_companies funders
 LEFT JOIN tutorial.crunchbase_investments startups
 ON funders.permalink = startups.company_permalink
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 2 DESC
 

From Question 4 a new dataset is used.
For the next few lessons, you'll work with data on College Football Players. 
This data was collected from ESPN on January 15, 2014 from the rosters listed on https://www.espn.com/college-football/teams
This dataset has two tables
Table 1: benn.college_football_players contains the records of players from all schools across USA
Table 2: benn.college_football_teams contains data more about the schools


Question 4:
A query to find the average weight of players from schools who participated in a conference

SELECT teams.conference AS conference,
AVG(players.weight) AS average_weight
FROM benn.college_football_players players
JOIN benn.college_football_teams teams
ON teams.school_name = players.school_name
GROUP BY teams.conference
ORDER BY AVG(players.weight) DESC
 
Question 5:

SELECT
CASE WHEN state = 'CA' AND year IN ('FR','SO') then 'Underclass'
WHEN state ='CA' AND year IN ('JR','SR') then 'Upperclass'
END AS class_of_player,
SUM (Weight) as weight_sum
FROM benn.college_football_players
GROUP BY class_of_player
